## Overview
Since the backgrounds for the training and testing images in the MSTAR database are highly-correlated, carrying out performance evaluation for the SAR ATR algorithms based solely on the limited samples from the MSTAR dataset is potentially biased. To evaluate the impact of the clutter background on SAR target classification, we leverage the clutter data in the MSTAR dataset, which are segmented into 1,159 clutter chips of size 128 Ã—128 and divided into two distinctive pools for training and testing, respectively. New training and test image samples are generated by implementing the clutter transfer technique, based on which the robustness of the target classification algorithms in clutters with different levels of homogeneity is evaluated. Simulation results show that the target classification performance of the existing algorithms degrades noticeably if we employ the original MSTAR image samples for training and apply clutter transfer to the test samples only. However, by introducing training data with various clutter backgrounds, the algorithm is robust against the background changes of the test samples.
